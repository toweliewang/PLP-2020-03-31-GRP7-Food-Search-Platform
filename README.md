## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

With the availability of information at their fingertips (through their smart phone), many consumers rely on online restaurant reviews to select their next dining experience. However, with the huge number of reviews, it is impossible to read through all the reviews before deciding on the perfect dining place for that very important date/meeting. Moreover, the Internet is littered with fake reviews designed to mislead consumers.
 
Similar information overload challenge exists for restaurant owners who wants to know what consumers are talking about their restaurant. It is simply too time consuming to manually gather, read through and compile the online reviews into actionable insights to improve their business.
 
The team proposes an Intelligent Language Processing System which identify and filter fake online restaurant and food reviews, perform information extraction and sentiment and aspect mining and provide relevant and concise information to Consumers through a conversational user interface and to Restaurant Owners through a properly formatted customer sentiment analysis dashboard.
 
Through this process, the team has learnt immensely on the application of natural language processing techniques and how to incorporate them to provide useful services to the users. As an incidental, the team has developed an open source front end chatbot user interface.
